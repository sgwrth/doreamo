# About
Exploring a new tech stack: using .NET, React, and MongoDB to create a standard
CRUD app.  Organized in a monorepo containing API, UI, and database subdirectories.
The database files include a Docker compose.yaml, a JavaScript file with MongoDB
commands to run initially, as well as Bash scripts for connecting to the DB using
Mongosh.

# Features included so far
